<analysis>Here is the handover summary:

**original_problem_statement**:
The user initially requested to complete the 'Alt Season Monitor' feature by adding tooltips and populating the 'Top Opportunities' and 'Token Momentum Scores' sections with data.

Subsequently, the user asked to:
1.  Implement and explain the 'Strategy Simulation' feature, making it more user-friendly with clear descriptions of strategies (e.g., 'AVOID PUMP EXIT') and clickable actor links.
2.  Activate the 'Farm Network Graph', connect it to real data from the parser, and add an explanation of its purpose on the page.
3.  **Current priority:** Enhance the 'Farm Network Graph' to be interactive. When a user clicks on an actor (node) in the graph or the list below it, a modal or popup should appear displaying detailed information about that actor (e.g., bot percentage, reason for suspicion). The goal is to make the graph an actionable tool rather than just a visual representation.

**User's preferred language**: The user's primary language is Russian. The next agent MUST respond in Russian.

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack application with a React frontend, a Node.js/Fastify backend, and a Python proxy server. The application is fully set up and running. Three core features are visually complete but with varying levels of functionality:
1.  **Alt Season Monitor**: Fully functional and populated with seeded data.
2.  **Strategy Simulation**: Functional, with UI/UX improvements like explanations and clickable links. Data is from a seed script.
3.  **Farm Network Graph**: Visually functional and populated with data derived from the parser's output. However, it is **not interactive**, which is the current main issue.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working**: Implementing interactivity for the Farm Network Graph. The user wants to click on graph nodes (actors) to open a modal/popup with detailed information about that actor.
*   **Status**: NOT STARTED
*   **Agent Testing Done**: N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent to verify the new modal UI and its functionality, and the screenshot tool to capture the new UI element. A backend test will be needed for the new API endpoint that will serve the modal data.
*   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1: Farm Network Graph lacks interactivity and detailed information (P0)**
    *   **Description**: The Farm Network Graph on  displays nodes and connections but is static. Clicking on an actor's node or their name in the list below the graph does not do anything. The user needs to see detailed information (e.g., bot analysis, profile info) for each actor to make the feature useful.
    *   **Attempted fixes**: None. This is a new feature requirement based on the last completed work.
    *   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  **Backend**: Create a new API endpoint, for instance, , that retrieves detailed information about a specific actor from the MongoDB collections (, , etc.).
        2.  **Backend**: Implement the service logic for this new endpoint in the backend.
        3.  **Frontend**: In , add  handlers to the graph nodes and the list of actors.
        4.  **Frontend**: Create a new reusable modal component (e.g., ) to display the information.
        5.  **Frontend**: The  handler should call the new backend API, store the actor's details in the component's state, and trigger the modal to open and display the fetched data.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will fulfill the user's core request to make the graph an actionable, data-driven tool rather than just a visualization.
    *   **Status**: NOT STARTED
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both.
    *   **Blocked on other issue**: None.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks currently in progress. The focus is on the pending issue above.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    *   **P1**: Investigate and fix the duplicate route warnings that appear when starting the backend server. While non-critical, this indicates a potential code structure issue in the Fastify routes.

- **Feature Implementation & Enhancement**:
  - **Alt Season Monitor**: Completed the feature by implementing tooltips and populating all data sections (, ) using seed scripts ().
  - **Strategy Simulation**: Made the page functional and significantly improved its UX by adding detailed explanations for each strategy and historical event logs with clickable actor links. Data is populated via .
  - **Farm Network Graph**: Activated the graph, connected it to data from the parser's collections () via a seed script, and added a descriptive text block to the page ().

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   **Issue 1: Duplicate Route Warnings in Backend**
    *   **Description**: The Node.js backend logs warnings like  upon startup. The agent noted this but deemed it non-critical and proceeded.
    *   **Debug checklist**: Review all route definition files in  to find and consolidate or remove the duplicated route registrations.
    *   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: To ensure backend stability and follow best practices. It might prevent unpredictable behavior where the wrong handler is executed for a given route.
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: Backend.
    *   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (occurs on every server start).

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI
*   **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript, TSX
*   **Database**: MongoDB
*   **Process Management**: Supervisor
*   **Architecture**: A Python proxy () listens for frontend requests and forwards them to the Node.js backend. This setup might be for handling authentication or CORS in a specific way.

**key DB schema**
The agent interacted with the following MongoDB collections:
*   : Stores probability data for Alt Season Monitor.
*   : Stores market state metrics.
*   : Stores top token opportunities.
*   : Stores token momentum scores.
*   : Stores simulation results and historical events.
*   , : Stores the graph data for Farm Network.
*   , : Collections populated by the parser, used as a source for the real farm network data.

**changes in tech stack**
*   None in this session.

**All files of reference**
*   : Created to seed Alt Season Monitor data.
*   : Created to seed Top Opportunities data.
*   : Created to seed Token Momentum Scores.
*   : Created to seed Strategy Simulation data.
*   : Created to populate the Farm Network graph with data from the parser's collections.
*   : Modified to read from the correct collection name.
*   : Modified to add explanatory text, a historical log, and clickable links.
*   : Modified to add an explanatory text block.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The multiple, single-purpose seeding scripts in  could be consolidated into a more robust, unified seeding mechanism, perhaps managed by a single command.
*   The duplicate route issue in the backend should be addressed.

**key api endpoints**
*   : Gets data for the Alt Season Monitor.
*   : Gets data for the Token Momentum Scores.
*   : Gets data for the Strategy Simulation page.
*   : Gets nodes and edges for the Farm Network Graph.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The project consists of three main services that must be running: the Python proxy (), the Node.js backend (), and the React frontend (). Use frontend: started
code-server: started to run them.
*   All features currently rely on data populated by seed scripts located in . To reset or populate data, you may need to re-run these scripts.
*   The user's immediate and highest-priority task is to add interactivity (a details modal on click) to the Farm Network Graph.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
*    (updated by the agent)
*   Test reports were generated after each major implementation phase, but the paths are not stored in the summary. The agent confirmed tests passed via .

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
*   **User Message (Latest)**: The Farm Network Graph is visually present but not useful. It needs interactivity. Clicking on an actor (node) or a name in the list below must open a modal/popup with detailed information about that actor (bot probability, etc.) to make the tool actionable. (Status: **Pending Implementation**)
*   **User Message**: Requested improvements for Strategy Simulation (add on-page explanations in English, clarify terms, make actors clickable) and to connect Farm Network to real parser data. (Status: **Completed**)
*   **User Message**: Requested the implementation of 'Strategy Simulation' and 'Farm Network Graph', explanations for their purpose, and a re-check of 'Alt Season Monitor'. (Status: **Completed**)

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken**: The core user-facing functionality of the Farm Network Graph is incomplete, as it lacks the required interactivity.
*   **Mocked**: The application's data is not live. It's populated from seed scripts that run once. While some seeds use data from the parser's database, it's still a static snapshot, not a continuous stream.

**3rd Party Integrations**
*   None identified from the conversation history.

**Testing status**
*   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: NO (Agent used  directly).
*   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO.
*   **Test files created**: None. Existing test suites were used.
*   **Known regressions**: None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
*   No credentials are required for the current workflow.

**What agent forgot to execute**
*   The agent has addressed all user requests sequentially. The only unexecuted task is the most recent one regarding the Farm Network Graph interactivity, which is now the primary pending issue.</analysis>
